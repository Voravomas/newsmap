# Newsmap
Made as a diploma project

## Goal
The main goal of this project is to create a website that would allow its users to see the news more conveniently. It would be a visual map that divides the country by regions and contain news for each separate region. Also, a time field will filter news
by time.<br/>
This website will require a robust API that processes articles and stores them in a database.

## Updates
Current news providers are:
1. Pravda
2. NV
3. CensorNet
